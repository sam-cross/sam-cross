# Hello, Visitor!

**I develop beautiful, impactful online experiences for brands** through professional web design and development, SEO and marketing services, and IT consultancy.

## Who Am I?

I'm a web designer with a passion for business, I drink too much coffee, and I'm always trying to learn something!

## What's on my GitHub?

I use GitHub to share personal projects, such as [departr](https://github.com/sam-cross/departr) and my [CSS-only responsive website header](https://github.com/sam-cross/css-only-responsive-header).

## What Am I Using?

I'm constantly learning the tech I use every day - I think this is true for any good developer - but I have a good grasp of the concepts behind most of what I use:

-   React.js
-   Next.js
-   Node.js
-   Express
-   REST APIs
-   WordPress
