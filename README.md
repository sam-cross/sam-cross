# Hello, Visitor.

**I develop impactful online experiences for brands** through a range of online solutions, including:

* Responsive Web Design and Front-End Development
* SEO and Social Media Marketing
* IT Consultancy

## Who Am I?

Right now, I'm working as an IT Helpdesk Technician in the public sector, alongside [my own brand](https://samcross.digital).

I fiddle with technology, have a passion for IT, drink too much coffee, and I'm always trying to learn something.

## What's on my GitHub?

I use GitHub to share my open-source code, for projects like [departr](https://github.com/sam-cross/departr), a work-in-progress UK transport tracker, and my somewhat-popular [CSS-only responsive website header](https://github.com/sam-cross/css-only-responsive-header).

## Technologies

I'm constantly learning the tech I use every day, but I have a good grasp of the concepts behind most of what I use.

-   JAMstack
-   React (and Next.js!)
-   Node.js
-   Express (and REST APIs)

## Where Are My Projects?

[My Portfolio](https://samcross.digital/portfolio) is a showcase of some of my work. I also have [design work on Behance](https://be.net/samcross) and code right here on GitHub.

## Code Like Me

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a lot of extensions and customised settings. Download the **Settings Sync** extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, and [click here](https://gist.github.com/sam-cross/02dea6d7b2155af712f03238c3eaf91f) to fork my Code settings. Then sign into the extension and download settings from the forked Gist.
