## Who Am I?

I'm a web designer with a passion for business, I drink too much coffee, and I'm always trying to learn something!

## What's on my GitHub?

I use GitHub to share my open-source code, for projects like [departr](https://github.com/sam-cross/departr) and my [CSS-only responsive website header](https://github.com/sam-cross/css-only-responsive-header).

## Technologies

I'm constantly learning the tech I use every day - I think this is true for any good developer - but I have a good grasp of the concepts behind most of what I use:

-   React.js
-   Next.js
-   Node.js
-   Express
-   REST APIs
-   WordPress

## Where Are My Projects?

[My Portfolio](https://samcross.digital/portfolio) is a showcase of all my recent work. I also have [design work on Behance](https://be.net/samcross) and code right here on GitHub!

## Code Like Me

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a lot of extensions and customised settings. Download the **Settings Sync** extension from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, and [click here](https://gist.github.com/sam-cross/02dea6d7b2155af712f03238c3eaf91f) to fork my Code settings. Then sign into the extension and download settings from the forked Gist.
